# Contribute to the Bookcrossing Mobile project

There are several possibilities to help us develop Bookcrossing Mobile:

## Report bugs or request features

All the bugs and feature requests filled by Github issues. There are issue template available. If
something is unclear to you during development, feel free to ask through Github issues.

## Develop features

To contribute directly to the code, fork the project and follow our [build instructions](BUILD.md)
to make project compile. When you've done, send us a pull request to the `dev` branch. We use
[Square Android code style](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles), so before sending a pull
request, make sure your changes follow our code style.

## Write tests

Currently the project has no test, but we intend to cover it with UI tests.
So, if you are the QA specialist, feel free to consult us, suggest test cases or write test by
yourself (if you want).

## Translate

Strings for translation are available on
[Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/bookcrossing-mobile/bookcrossing-mobile-app).
For now, app is translated to Russian only, and we work hard on German translation. You can help
also with Spanish or Hindi right now, or request new language as well.
