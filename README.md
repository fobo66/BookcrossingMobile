This is an Android app for exchanging books. You can download it free on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bookcrossing.mobile).

There is a global [Bookcrossing](https://www.bookcrossing.com) website that gather community since 2001, but we decided to
write our mobile-first solution separately of the main project due to it's bad API design. We have separate database of books,
and the app is not affiliated with Bookcrossing.com team at any kind.

We use today's most popular and powerful instruments in our app, such as Firebase, Moxy MVP framework,
RxJava 2, Dagger 2, etc. So, this project may be useful as an example on integration of these tools
and gluing them together.
