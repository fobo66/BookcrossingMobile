This is an Android app for exchanging books. You can download it free on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bookcrossing.mobile).

There is a [global Bookcrossing website](http://www.bookcrossing.com/) that gather community since 2001, but we decided to write our 
mobile-first solution separately of the main project due to it's bad API design.

We use today's most popular and powerful instruments in our app, such as Firebase, Moxy MVP framework,
RxJava 2, Dagger 2, etc. So, this project may be useful as an example on integration of these tools 
and gluing them together.
